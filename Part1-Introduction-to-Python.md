# ***INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON***

## **WHAT IS PYTHON**  ü§î

***Python*** is a ***high-level open-source programming language***, which means that both humans and machines can understand it. It is among the most widely used programming languages because of its easiness while working compared to other languages like ***C, C++, JAVA,*** etc 


## **HISTORY OF PYTHON** :crown:

 ***Python*** was originated in the late ***1980s*** by a Dutch programmer ***Guido van Rossum*** for whom he was the ***benevolent dictator for life (BDPL)*** until ***July 2018***. There were many python versions like ***python2 and python3*** present most of them are using ***python3.*** 

## **WHO CAN LEARN PYTHON.** :computer: :boy: :man:

<span style="color:BLACK;font-size:1.25em; font-family:caveat;"> Any ***beginner*** interested in the beautiful world of ***programming*** can learn ***python*** because it is a programming language that everyone can ***understand*** without having knowledge in it. </span>

## **WHY PYTHON?**  ü§î


Here are few ***Advantages*** of python because of which ***python*** is chosen by a wide range of people. 

1. ***Python*** is ***open source*** and is used for ***community development.***

2. It is easy to ***learn and understand.***

3.  It ***portable*** and it is ***interactive.***

4. It is an ***object-oriented programming language*** and also a ***high-level programming language.***

5. It is a ***dynamically*** typed programming language that means no need to mention the ***data type*** based on the value assigned.

6. It has extensive help of ***libraries like NumPy, pandas, so on..***.



## **APPLICATIONS OF PYTHON** :clipboard:

***Web Development***: Using libraries like **Flask** and **Django** websites can be developed. 

***Machine Learning***: It is branch of ***Artificial Intelligence*** where it consists of vast range of ***libraries.*** :bar_chart:

***Prototyping***: It is nothing but the ***models*** which are used to ***explain the design of the application or system*** in brief to the ***clients***. 

***GUI based applications***: ***Python Libraries*** are used to develop ***Games*** or ***Scientific Applications***. :video_game:

## ***BASIC PYTHON SYNTAX*** :memo:

**1. Print()**

All of us would have learned other ***programming language*** with evergreen example of printing **"Hello world !!!"**. It's same for ***python,*** like any other programming language ***print function*** is the most important and baby step that you take while learning any particular language.

***Print function prints the specified message or text on the screen, or other standard output device.***
 

<span style="color:black; font-family: caveat; font-size:1.25em;">Lets begin by printing **"Hello World !"** example.</span>


```python
print("Hello World !")
```

    Hello World !
    

<span style="color:black; font-family: caveat; font-size:1.25em;">***String variables*** can be ***declared*** either by using ***single or double quotes.***</span>


<span style="color:black; font-family: caveat; font-size:1.25em;"> Lets look at an other ***example*** </span>


```python
print "Hello World !"
```


      File "<ipython-input-29-512c8e33c649>", line 1
        print "Hello World !"
              ^
    SyntaxError: Missing parentheses in call to 'print'. Did you mean print("Hello World !")?
    


<span style="color:black; font-family: caveat; font-size:1.25em;">From the above example we can understand that ***paranthesis*** is a must else it will raise ***syntax error.***</span>

<span style="color:black; font-family: caveat; font-size:1.25em;">Why do we say ***print*** as ***function*** rather than ***statement?*** let's check. </span>


```python
type(print)
```

<span style="color:black; font-family: caveat; font-size:1.25em;">From the above ***example*** we can conclude that ***print*** is ***not a statement*** instead its a ***function.*** 

<span style="color:black; font-family: caveat; font-size:1.25em;">Lets learn how to ***print strings,numbers ,basic calculation.***</span>

- to print strings : print("Sentence/ string")
- to print numbers : print(number)
- to print basic operation : print(number operator number)



```python
print("Welcome")
print(1)
print(2+3)
print(7-2)

```

    Welcome
    1
    5
    5
    

<span style="color:black; font-family: caveat; font-size:1.25em;">**2.Value initialization**</span>

- Python has no command for declaring a variable.
- A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
- a variable is a label that you can assign a value to it
- Use the variable_name = value to create a variable.

<span style="color:black; font-family: caveat; font-size:1.25em;">Lets learn how to **initialize**</span>
- for strings : variable= " string or a sentence"
- for integers : variable=numbers
- for operations : variable= number1 operator number2


```python
x = 5
y = "Apple"
print(x)
print(y)
```

    5
    Apple
    

<span style="color:black; font-family: caveat; font-size:1.25em;">**Casting**</span> 
- it is used to specify the datatype of a variable.


```python
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
```

<span style="color:black; font-family: caveat; font-size:1.25em;">You can get the **data type** of a **variable** with the **type() function.**


```python
type(x)
```




    str




```python
x = 5
y = "Apple"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
```

    <class 'int'>
    <class 'str'>
    

<span style="color:black; font-family: caveat; font-size:1.25em;">**3.input() / value input**</span>

- input() is a built-in function.
- reads a line from the input (usually from the user).
- This function takes exactly what is typed from the keyboard, convert it to string and then return it to the variable in which we want to store.

<span style="color:black; font-family: caveat; font-size:1.25em;">**syntax : input(prompt)**</span>

<span style="color:black; font-family: caveat; font-size:1.25em;">prompt is optional, it is a **string representing** a **default** message before the **input.**</span>


```python
x = input('Enter your name:')
print('Good evening, ' + x)
```

    Enter your name:world
    Good evening, world
    

<span style="color:black; font-family: caveat; font-size:1.25em;">Lets learn how to take **input for strings**, **integers** and **float** variable.

- for strings : variable=input(string)
- for integers : variable=int(input())
- for float : variable=float(input())

<span style="color:black; font-family: caveat; font-size:1.25em;">**Example :**</span>


```python
x = input("Enter the value for x: ") #lets give input string
print(x)
y = input("Enter the value for y: ") #lets give input integer
print(y)
z= input("Enter the value for z: ") #lets give input float
print(z)
```

    Enter the value for x: world
    world
    Enter the value for y: 9
    9
    Enter the value for z: 6.0
    6.0
    

<span style="color:black; font-family: caveat; font-size:1.25em;">**4.Comments**</span>

- Comments are used to explain python code
- Comments are descriptions that help programmers to understand the intent and functionality of the program, and comments are completely ignored by the python interpreter.

<span style="color:black; font-family: caveat; font-size:1.25em;">We use **"#" symbol** at the **beginning** of each line to **create multiple line comments.** </span>


```python
x=1
y=2
z=3
print(x) #comment1
print(y) #comment2
print(z) #comment3
```

    1
    2
    3
    

<span style="color:black; font-family: caveat; font-size:1.25em;">We can also use **string literals** for **multi line comments**, **Python** will **ignore string literals** that are **not assigned to a variable.**</span>


```python
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")
```

    Hello, World!
    

## ***Python Identifiers***

- ***Identifier is the name given to a variable,function,class, module or other objects.***
- ***An identifier can begin with an alphabet (A-Z or a-z), or an underscore(_) and can include any number of letters,digits,or underscores***
- ***Spaces are not allowed***

**Example :** 
- MyName                      
***space is not allowed***
- My_Name                   
***cannot start with a digit, can use underscore(_)***
## ***Reserved Keywords*** :page_with_curl:

- ***Python has a list of reserved words known as keywords.***
- ***every keyword has a specific purpose and use***


<span style="color:black; font-family: caveat; font-size:1.25em;">Here are the **List of keywords in Python :**</span>
- and 
- as
- assert
- break
- class
- continue
- def
- del
- elif
- else
- except
- False
- finally
- for
- from
- global
- if
- import
- in
- is
- lambda
- None
- nonlocal
- not
- or
- pass
- raise
- return
- True
- try
